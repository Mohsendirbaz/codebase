# True Configuration Space Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the true configuration space in the application. The implementation properly accounts for the multiplicative relationship between parameters, scaling groups, sensitivity variations, years, and versions, creating a much larger configuration space than initially estimated.

## Key Changes

The following files were updated to implement the true configuration space:

1. **ConflictResolutionPanel.js**: Updated to handle conflicts at the parameter-scaling group level
2. **EfficacyMapContainer.js**: Enhanced to display the true configuration space and integrate with CapacityMapPanel
3. **TimeParameterMatrix.js**: Updated to visualize parameters and scaling groups with their efficacy periods
4. **CapacityTrackingService.js**: Modified to track and calculate the true configuration space
5. **EfficacyMapContainer.css**: Updated with styles for the new UI elements
6. **TimeParameterMatrix.css**: Updated with styles for the new matrix visualization

## Implementation Details

### Degree of Freedom Constraint

The implementation enforces the degree of freedom constraint: only one value per parameter per scaling group per time unit (year) is allowed. This creates a multiplicative effect on capacity:

```
Parameters × Scaling Groups × Sensitivity Variations × Years × Versions
```

### Scaling Groups Enhancement

The key insight implemented is that each scaling group enjoys the same customization capabilities as base parameters, including sensitivity variations for every time unit. This creates a much larger configuration space than initially estimated.

### Configuration Space Visualization

The EfficacyMapContainer now includes a configuration space visualization that shows the theoretical maximum number of distinct values possible with the current settings:

```
Parameters × Scaling Groups × Sensitivity Variations × Years × Versions = Total Distinct Values
```

### Capacity Tracking

The CapacityTrackingService has been updated to track:
- Parameters usage
- Scaling groups usage
- Sensitivity variations usage
- Configurable versions usage
- Plant lifetime usage

It also calculates the total capacity usage based on the multiplicative relationship between these components.

### Matrix Visualization

The TimeParameterMatrix component now has two view modes:
1. **Parameter View**: Shows only parameters
2. **Scaling Group View**: Shows parameters with their scaling groups

This allows users to visualize the full configuration space and identify conflicts at the parameter-scaling group level.

### Conflict Resolution

The ConflictResolutionPanel has been updated to handle conflicts at the parameter-scaling group level, allowing users to resolve conflicts where multiple values exist for the same parameter-scaling group-year combination.

## Exclusions from Combinatorial Calculations

The following elements are excluded from combinatorial calculations to maintain focus on the core parameters:

1. **Number of plots** - These are considered trivial multipliers and are excluded from capacity calculations
2. **Interchangeable x and y axes** - These are treated as a single configuration option
3. **Zones** - Currently only one area is considered for calculations

## Conclusion

The implementation of the true configuration space provides a more accurate representation of the application's capacity and helps users understand the multiplicative relationship between parameters, scaling groups, sensitivity variations, years, and versions. This enables better capacity planning and resource allocation.
