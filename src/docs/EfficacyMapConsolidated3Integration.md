# Efficacy Map Integration in Consolidated3.js

## Overview

This document describes the integration of the Efficacy Map components into the Consolidated3.js file. The components were previously integrated into the main application (HomePage.js) and have now been implemented in Consolidated3.js as well to maintain consistency across the application.

## Integration Details

The following components have been integrated into Consolidated3.js:

1. **EfficacyMapContainer**: The main container component that integrates the TimeParameterMatrix and ConflictResolutionPanel components.

### Implementation

The integration was implemented by:

1. Adding the import statement for the EfficacyMapContainer component at the top of the Consolidated3.js file:
   ```javascript
   import EfficacyMapContainer from './components/modules/EfficacyMapContainer';
   ```

2. Adding the 'Scaling' sub-tab content section to render the EfficacyMapContainer:
   ```javascript
   {/* Scaling Tab */}
   {activeSubTab === 'Scaling' && (
       <>
           {/* Integrate EfficacyMapContainer */}
           <EfficacyMapContainer
               parameters={formMatrix}
               plantLifetime={formMatrix?.plantLifetimeAmount10?.value || 20}
               configurableVersions={20}
               scalingGroups={scalingGroups.length || 5}
               onParameterUpdate={(paramId, updatedParam) => {
                   handleInputChange(
                       { target: { value: updatedParam.value } },
                       paramId
                   );
               }}
           />
       </>
   )}
   ```

### Props Passed to EfficacyMapContainer

The following props are passed to the EfficacyMapContainer:

- **parameters**: The form matrix object containing all parameters
- **plantLifetime**: The plant lifetime from the form values (default: 20)
- **configurableVersions**: The default value (20)
- **scalingGroups**: The number of scaling groups (default: 5)
- **onParameterUpdate**: A function to handle parameter updates

## User Experience

When users navigate to the Scaling sub-tab in Consolidated3.js, they will now see the EfficacyMapContainer, which includes:
- A summary of capacity settings with visual indicators
- A matrix visualization of parameter efficacy periods
- Tools to identify and resolve conflicts

This integration provides users with a consistent experience between the main application and the consolidated version, ensuring that the degree of freedom constraint (one value per parameter per time unit) is maintained across all interfaces.

## Conclusion

The integration of the Efficacy Map components into Consolidated3.js ensures consistency across the application and provides users with powerful tools to visualize and manage parameter efficacy periods while ensuring the degree of freedom constraint is maintained.
