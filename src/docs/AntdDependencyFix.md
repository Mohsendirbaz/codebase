# Fixing Antd Dependency Issues

## Issue Description

The build process was failing with the following errors:

```
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'antd' in 'C:\Users\Mohse\IdeaProjects3\ONE1\src\components\modules'
ERROR in ./src/components/modules/CapacityMapPanel.js 6:0-129
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'antd' in 'C:\Users\Mohse\IdeaProjects3\ONE1\src\components\modules'

ERROR in ./src/components/modules/CapacityMapPanel.js 7:0-145
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@ant-design/icons' in 'C:\Users\Mohse\IdeaProjects3\ONE1\src\components\modules'
```

These errors occurred because the `CapacityMapPanel.js` component uses components from the `antd` library and icons from `@ant-design/icons`, but these dependencies were not installed in the project.

## Solution

The solution was to add these dependencies to the `package.json` file. The following dependencies were added:

```json
"@ant-design/icons": "^5.3.0",
"antd": "^5.15.0",
```

## How to Complete the Fix

To complete the fix, you need to install the dependencies by running one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

or if you're using yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

This will install the missing dependencies based on the updated `package.json` file.

## Alternative Solutions Considered

An alternative solution would have been to rewrite the `CapacityMapPanel.js` component to use native HTML and React components instead of relying on external libraries. However, this would have required a significant rewrite of the component, as it uses many different components from the `antd` library, including:

- Card
- Typography (Title, Text, Paragraph)
- Slider
- InputNumber
- Row
- Col
- Divider
- Progress
- Tooltip
- Switch
- Table
- Button
- Alert
- Icons (InfoCircleOutlined, SettingOutlined, LineChartOutlined, WarningOutlined, PieChartOutlined, AreaChartOutlined)

Given the complexity of the component and the number of dependencies, adding the missing libraries to the project was the most efficient solution.

## Benefits of Using Antd

Ant Design (antd) is a popular UI library for React that provides a comprehensive set of high-quality components. Using antd offers several benefits:

1. **Consistent Design**: All components follow the Ant Design specification, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
2. **Rich Component Set**: Antd provides a wide range of components, from basic buttons to complex data tables.
3. **Responsive Design**: Components are designed to work well on different screen sizes.
4. **Accessibility**: Many components have built-in accessibility features.
5. **Theming**: Antd supports customization through theming.

By using antd, we can focus on building the application's functionality rather than spending time on UI component implementation.
