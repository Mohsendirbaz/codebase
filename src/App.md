# App.js - Architectural Summary

## Overview
Main application entry point for a React-based ModEcon Matrix System. Serves as the root component that initializes routing, error boundaries, and theme management.

## Core Architecture

### Level 1: Application Bootstrap
- **React Router Integration**: Single-page application with BrowserRouter
- **Error Boundary Wrapper**: Top-level error handling for entire application
- **Style Imports**: Economic library and factual precedence UI styles

### Level 2: Theme Management System
- **Dynamic Theme Color Extraction**
  - `getColorFromTheme()`: Extracts CSS variable values from theme classes
  - Creates temporary DOM elements to compute styles
  - Validates hex color format with regex pattern
  - Fallback to black (#000000) on errors

- **Theme Color Averaging**
  - `getAverageThemeColor()`: Computes average color across multiple themes
  - Hex-to-RGB conversion for mathematical operations
  - RGB averaging across light, dark, and creative themes
  - RGB-to-hex reconversion for CSS application

### Level 3: Runtime Configuration
- **Effect Hook Implementation**
  - Applies average colors on component mount
  - Sets CSS custom properties dynamically
  - Error handling with console logging
  - Fallback color values for robustness

## Component Structure
```
App
├── ErrorBoundary (wrapper)
│   └── Router
│       └── Routes
│           └── Route "/" → HomePage
```

## Key Features
1. **Single route application** - HomePage as default
2. **Theme-aware styling** - Computes average colors from multiple themes
3. **Robust error handling** - Multiple fallback mechanisms
4. **CSS variable manipulation** - Runtime style adjustments

## Dependencies
- React & React Router DOM
- HomePage component
- ErrorBoundary utility
- CSS modules for economic library and factual precedence
