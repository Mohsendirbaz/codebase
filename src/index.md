# index.js - Architectural Summary

## Overview
The application entry point that bootstraps the React application using React 18's new root API with Concurrent Mode features.

## Core Architecture

### Level 1: Application Bootstrap
- **React 18 Integration**: Uses createRoot API for concurrent features
- **Strict Mode**: Enables additional development checks and warnings
- **DOM Mounting**: Attaches React app to root element

### Level 2: Technical Implementation
```javascript
Entry Flow:
1. Import React and createRoot from React DOM
2. Import main App component
3. Get DOM container element by ID
4. Create React root with container
5. Render App within StrictMode wrapper
```

## Key Features
- **Concurrent Rendering**: Enables React 18's concurrent features
- **Development Warnings**: StrictMode double-invokes lifecycle methods
- **Error Boundaries**: Prepared for error boundary integration
- **Performance**: Optimized for React 18's automatic batching

## Dependencies
- React 18+
- React DOM 18+
- App component
- HTML element with id="root"
