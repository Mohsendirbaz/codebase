## Component Interactions

### NavigationManager
- Controls the overall navigation flow between different analysis modes
- Maintains breadcrumb navigation state
- Handles keyboard shortcuts and accessibility
- Communicates with parent ModelZone for state updates

### ModelCard
- Serves as the primary interface for model configuration
- Integrates with PriceDisplay for real-time pricing updates
- Connects with EfficacyIndicator for model effectiveness metrics
- Triggers various analysis modes through action buttons
- Maintains inheritance relationships between models

### AnalysisVisualizationIntegration
- Manages the synchronization between analysis state and visualizations
- Handles data transformations and caching
- Provides a unified interface for all visualization components
- Implements debouncing and performance optimizations

### OptimizationEngine
- Runs optimization algorithms for model parameters
- Visualizes optimization results through AnalysisChart
- Maintains optimization state and constraints
- Provides real-time feedback during optimization process

### SensitivityEngine
- Performs sensitivity analysis on model parameters
- Integrates with EfficacyIndicator for impact assessment
- Visualizes sensitivity results through AnalysisChart
- Handles Monte Carlo simulations

### ImpactAnalysis
- Analyzes model changes and their impacts
- Visualizes impact metrics through AnalysisChart
- Provides comparative analysis between models
- Generates impact reports and recommendations

## Data Flow

1. **Model Configuration**
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   A[ModelCard] --> B[PriceDisplay]
   B --> C[EfficacyIndicator]
   C --> D[State Update]
   D --> A
   ```

2. **Analysis Flow**
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   A[User Input] --> B[Analysis Engine]
   B --> C[Data Processing]
   C --> D[Visualization]
   D --> E[UI Update]
   ```

3. **Optimization Cycle**
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   A[Parameters] --> B[Optimization]
   B --> C[Evaluation]
   C --> D[Update]
   D --> A
   ```

## State Management

### Version State
- Managed through VersionStateContext
- Tracks current model version and extensions
- Handles version comparisons and inheritance

### Analysis State
- Maintained in respective analysis engines
- Includes calculation status and results
- Manages caching and performance optimization

### UI State
- Controlled by NavigationManager
- Handles component visibility and transitions
- Manages user interaction states

## Event System

### Custom Events
1. `priceDataLoaded`: Triggered when price data is available
2. `analysisComplete`: Fired when analysis finishes
3. `optimizationUpdate`: Real-time optimization progress
4. `efficacyCalculated`: When efficacy metrics are ready

### Event Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    ModelCard->>PriceDisplay: Request Price
    PriceDisplay->>System: Load Data
    System->>EfficacyIndicator: Price Data Event
    EfficacyIndicator->>ModelCard: Update Metrics
```

## Integration Points

### API Services
- `apiService.js`: Handles all external API calls
- `integrationService.js`: Manages component integration
- `dataProcessing.js`: Common data transformation utilities

### Shared Resources
- CSS Variables
- Utility Functions
- Type Definitions
- Configuration Constants

## Performance Considerations

1. **Data Management**
   - Implement caching for analysis results
   - Use debouncing for real-time updates

   - Use React.memo for pure components
   - Implement virtualization for large datasets

3. **Computation Efficiency**
   - Run heavy calculations in web workers
   - Use batch updates for state changes
   - Implement progressive loading for large models

## Error Handling

1. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Fallback UI for failed components
   - Retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Clear error messages and recovery options

2. **Error Boundaries**
   - Component-level error catching
   - State recovery mechanisms
   - User feedback systems
