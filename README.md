## 🌟 Overview

TEA Space is a modern environment for techno-economic analysis that turns complex process economics into a structured, defensible narrative. Built on a matrix-native backbone, it treats time and uncertainty as first-class citizens and preserves the provenance of every assumption and change. Analysts move fluidly from scenario design to consolidated results without losing traceability, and teams iterate with shared context and clear accountability. The platform emphasizes clarity, auditability, and extensibility—designed to evolve with emerging environmental metrics and regulatory lenses.


### 🎯 Key Features

Completed

Core CFA engine performs base cash-flow analysis across multiple scenarios, consolidating intervalized configurations into a single financial horizon.

Aggregated visualization layer: supports dynamic (interactive) dashboards and static (publication-ready) plots across scenarios.

Time-based parameter control interface (activation windows and levels) enabling fine-grained scenario design.

Centralized console for complex scaling and factorization of cost components across parameter types and configurations.

Scenario import/export for collaboration (structured bundles with metadata for sharing and versioning).

In progress

Migration to a matrix-based computation layer with advanced React state management to improve determinism, performance, and UI responsiveness.

Planned

Climate Intelligence Layer integrating material-level carbon accounting, complementing component-, equipment-, and plant-level series to extend TEA with footprint and intensity metrics.
