## üåü Overview

TEA Space is a cutting-edge techno-economic analysis platform that revolutionizes process economics evaluation through innovative matrix-based architecture, advanced environmental intelligence, and AI-powered assistance. Designed for industrial and chemical process optimization, TEA Space uniquely combines financial modeling with carbon tracking and regulatory compliance.

### üéØ Key Features

‚Ä¢ **Advanced Financial Modeling Engine**: Built a comprehensive Cash Flow Analysis (CFA) system with modular revenue/expense component tracking, supporting complex industrial process economics with time-sensitive parameter activation through the proprietary Efficacy Time System.

‚Ä¢ **Multi-dimensional Parameter Management**: Engineered a unified matrix state management system that treats all parameters as elements in a 5-dimensional space (versions, zones, time periods, configurations, and capacity), enabling powerful cross-dimensional comparisons and inheritance patterns with theoretical capacity handling up to 900,000 configurations.

‚Ä¢ **Comprehensive Climate Intelligence Module**: Implemented multi-dimensional carbon tracking across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions with configurable emission factors for equipment, installation, materials, energy, and transportation. Features specialized tracking for hard-to-decarbonize sectors (steel, cement, chemicals) with interactive geospatial visualization using heatmaps, bubble charts, and gradient overlays.

‚Ä¢ **Three-Tier Regulatory Compliance Framework**: Developed multilevel emissions treatment supporting local (municipal), state (regional), and federal (national) regulatory thresholds with automatic compliance status monitoring (compliant/warning/non-compliant) and region-specific incentive integration including carbon tax rebates and emissions trading benefits.

‚Ä¢ **AI-Powered Factual Precedence System**: Integrated GPT-4 Turbo to provide context-aware historical business insights and parameter recommendations based on industry type, technology level, scale, and regulatory framework. The system analyzes corporate evolution patterns from companies like Tesla and Toyota to suggest phased deployment strategies, partnerships, and value-based pricing approaches.

‚Ä¢ **Intelligent Virtual Assistant for Modelers**: Built the Junie Connector Plugin providing inline AI-powered suggestions directly in the IDE, featuring sequential agent architecture with isolated contexts, ghost text suggestions, and asynchronous execution for seamless modeling assistance without disrupting workflow.

‚Ä¢ **Decarbonization Pathway Analysis**: Created a comprehensive pathway comparison system evaluating 8 pre-configured hydrogen production methods (renewable, low-carbon, fossil, emerging) with metrics including carbon intensity (1.2-18.2 kg CO2e/kg H2), technology readiness levels, water usage, and cost analysis, enabling side-by-side comparison of up to 4 pathways.

‚Ä¢ **Comprehensive Sensitivity Analysis Suite**: Implemented multiple sensitivity testing modes including percentage variation, direct value modification, absolute departure analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, all orchestrated through a sequential event processing system ensuring proper workflow execution.

‚Ä¢ **Interactive Visualization Framework**: Developed dynamic visualization capabilities using React/D3.js for real-time rendering of waterfall charts, operational cost breakdowns, cumulative economic summaries, capacity utilization tracking, and climate impact overlays with weighted calculations across all dimensions.

‚Ä¢ **Scalable Architecture with Environmental Focus**: Designed a modular full-stack solution using React.js with Jotai state management, Python Flask APIs with factory-based calculation engines, dual database integration (PostgreSQL/ClickHouse), and blockchain-ready architecture for future carbon credit tracking and immutable compliance records.

‚Ä¢ **Enterprise Environmental Features**: Incorporated multi-zone carbon generation with clustering analysis, regional system support (SI/USD and Europe/EUR), dynamic carbon incentive calculations, and machine learning readiness for predictive emissions modeling and optimization recommendations.
