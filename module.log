why are you using specifgather information to create a plan for implementing a custom ESLint rule that can differentiate between active and inactive files in a React project. Let me first analyze the file structure and understand what files I have access to.

From the environment details, I can see this is a React project with various components, services, and utilities. The task is to create a custom ESLint rule that:

Identifies the entry point (index.js) and recursively traces imports
Classifies standalone files (no further imports) as the final layer
Properly handles files that appear in multiple active paths
Considers only index.js as the entry point, not other hub filesic names instead of working on a blcok of code that tries to diffrentiate segment from full name,
similarly, methodically identify reachable files by examining nested directories, undo what you've been doing in resolving errors so pathetically
the middle patterns did not work, if a full name is part of another name, the renaming affects both, enforce impelemntation only on full names to avoid examples like this ./Filter[A]_[A]_Popup';
corrections were applied, however deeper edge problems there is no end to them apparently :))

we need to strengthen our renaming approach to use regex patterns to avoid pitfalls such as example attached. while popup statement itself is renamed correctly the filterpopup was incorrect. use error handlings to manage it
you do not need to see any of the files involved, you should work based on the logic that we verify and then edit the eslint files
hecking if a prefix already exists before adding one, would not be enough, if the inactive gets added first, the override rule does not take into effect
not the names, the file names in src get rnamed correctly, the importstatements of active files, your override rule is incorrect since its applying both rules.

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';
import useFormValues from './[A]_[I]_useFormValues';
import Popup from './[A]_[A]_Popup';
import { faEdit, faCheck, faTimes } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';
import SensitivityAnalysisSelector from './components/[A]_[A]_SensitivitySelector';



one example is the './[A]_[I]_useFormValues'; that since it is intgrated in both active variant of app and inactive one, the active is not preceding
add one special block to the restoration file and hardcode the index.js file so examining import statements of index.js becomes a permanet part of operation. we'll avoid all other hazard to existing functionalities
f it does not find its way to the dependency graph and restoration acts on that list, then it does directly affect the restoration process. tell me what list of files restoration operates on when executed
your understanding is correct now, check if there's anything in the .eslintrc.js file that might be affecting this.

I rejected that since you were tryimg to read index.js
I said share your plan. this was imprecise since renaming happens by both rename file and restoration file:

Remove the exemption so index.js can be renamed like other files

what you need to do is to make this conditional

rules: {
// Active files tracker rule - only runs when ANALYZE_ACTIVE_FILES=true
"active-files/active-files-tracker": [
"off", // Changed from "warn" to "off" to prevent messages in the editor
{
entryPoint: "src/index.js"
}
],


but first tell me exactly what the block above do for the logic of module. does it exempt index.js globally or we can condition it so it can be included in restoration act
index should stay exempt from the file you mentioned, mark-active-files.js

but only restoration be allowed to act on it, based on the existing logic.

share your plan
I need to affirm your understanding of the task first
index.js is exmpted via the .eslintrc.js if anything the most economical way would be to try that avenue, if we just remove that, the curent restoration easily handles that like any other file, are you clear on what I am saying?

so no I do not mean handle index.js imports more effectively, I mean try removing that exepmtion
dentified suspicious activity

does removing index.js exemption require rewriting what restore-filenames do? it mainly consists of patterns that apply to all sort of files.

I rejected that, but if you think it was not a mistake, make changes and it will be approved
it should apply to the name itself as well, since the way we defined it it only acts on available prefixes
as I said before the restoration needs to be stronger in every sense, allow it to cleanse the import statements of index.js as well, since renamed files do automatically get adjusted and unavoidably restoration should have access to that
Move the plugin to a separate ESLint configuration: Remove it from the main .eslintrc.js and only include it when explicitly running the analysis.restoration file only is handling file names, it must handle import statements as well, currently all iterations have added one A or I, to fix it, first update restoration to perform the sweeps we asked, that includes inside files. for the number of safety masures, you should keep it a numeric variable so not only be able to resolve the immediate problem of import statments with multi pre fixes (import useFormValues from './[A]_[I]_[I]_[I]_[I]_[I]_[I]_[I]_[I]_[I]_useFormValues';) but also enhance functionality by giving it flexability.
why are you adding hardcoded path to such a vibrant and dynamic module?you do not need to read this file, objective is clear, equipping the restoration file with cleaning the import statements that have file names in active or inactive mode. no independent effort should be initiated , it should be aligned with existing dependency graph modules, trackers etc
the importstatements continue to have their altered names with several prefixes, investigate why restoration file was not able to work in conjunction with dependency graph.
active files are defined by their dependency to the single active index.js in the src
restoration reporting is fixed.the restoration file skips file names in the import statements and active css files are being excluded,I do not understand why identifying and mapping dependency graphs requires making modification to files, it should start from entry point, process import statements recursively, log them and make the renames, for automatic renaming of files entring and exiting active status we would need additional auxiliary modules but the content of file easily should have been preserved by used and unused rules.
Index.js in src should have been excluded from renaming since by design stays as the fixed point regarding variants of app present in the app.
ead this again, where it says no need for renaming? opposite, it explicitely says once dependency graph mapped then do the renaming, even beyond that it acknoledges the need for addional codes to handle files entering and exiting active status cycle.1. how to enable and disable rul in .eslintrc ( will restoration be clean to its original state, or there will be traces?)
2. the request was to make them diffrentiable in vs code, content of files should have not been affected, currently serveral blocks of code in numerous files are showing eslint errors, warns, etc.
we wanted somthing that would require opening the file, visibly diffrentiate should have made my point clearly
I do not understand why identifying and mapping dependency graphs requires making modification to files, it should start from entry point, process import statements recursively, log them and make the renames, for automatic renaming of files entring and exiting active status we would need additional auxiliary modules but the content of file easily should have been preserved by used and unused rules.
the restoration file needs to be revisited since the futile execution
can you clarify how the marker will be displayed
Issue Identification
Based on your feedback, it appears the plugin installation and automated file marking aren't working as expected. The most common causes for this include:

Plugin Registration: The ESLint plugin may not be properly registered in the project's ESLint configuration.
File Access Permissions: The scripts may lack permissions to modify the source files directly.
Integration with ESLint's Fix System: The fixable rule implementation may not be correctly integrated with ESLint's auto-fix mechanism.
PS C:\Users\Mohse\OneDrive\Desktop\Milestone4 - Copy> node restore-filenames.js
>>
Starting filename restoration...
No files with [A]_ or [I]_ prefixes found.
increase the robustness of sweeps in terms of depth, and cover at leaset one extra prefix as safety measure (to handle accidental cases such as import { useVersionState } from '../contexts/[A]_[I]_VersionStateContext';
)

restoration summary should be corrected to report the number of files restored more accurately. By defenition restoration is only when at least one available prefix is removed.
the analyzer is not applying the pre fixes to css files, tracing dependencies should cover them as well
currently analzer mistakenly declares that single file as active and appends [I] to the rest of files. should be corrected.
analyzer should be exempt from flexible variable since varying number of prefixes wont be added, only they might appear by mistake and the restoration needs to be stronger that module that alters things, to ensure original state is protected.
the functionality of restoration and analyzers are correct, only remians what ahs been accumulated during development phase. given the eslint integration with the app, npm start revealed some of these redandancies,

these have been acheived after multiple corrections and MUST BE PRESERVED while fixing the issues remaining:


that is not the only absolute condition you should adhere by, some errors may give the impression that they be related to the logic of app or main codes, I need to assure you all have appeared only and only addition f ESLintPlugin, so in resolving them you should only focus on what is related to the resecnt implementation.


the changes you made to .eslintrc were ineffective. trying to resolve errors created is not the best approach, it discards the useful information that tells us with absolute certainty why they are there.

the request and workflow of ESLint plugin has some essential requirements, your implementation has left files in the condition attached.

unused parts must remain silent ( they used be only grayed out ), restore that deault since these accrued warns are unnecessary.
before that, tell me if any file outside src is being imported or is affected by renamings? in the example-files there are files with pre fixes, why is that the case?
the next issue we need to attend is the method of excluding index.js from renamings, I see a /* @active */ at top of file, is that the mechanism?

does identifying active files and addition of prefixes is accompanied by this marking as well?

if thats is the case, /* @inactive */
and /* @active */ are necessary to the process? or can be removed?

updating restoration to clean them up is one option. first explain, and I'll decide.
it was emphasized to avoid launching independent efforts such as this detached from existing dependency graph.

explain if by during development you mean npm start


Modify the active-files-tracker rule to only run its full analysis when explicitly called, not during normal development.
lets preserve the main ESLint configuration, since its a gateway to use of ESLint has to offer, instead treat the npm start by least intrusive method, Make the ESLint rule conditional: Modify the active-files-tracker rule to only run its full analysis when explicitly called, not during normal development.
